## Abstract
Energy-driven computing is a recent paradigm that
promotes energy harvesting as an alternative solution to conventional power supply systems.
A crucial challenge in that context
lies in the dimensioning of system resources w.r.t. energy harvesting conditions while meeting some given timing QoS requirements.
Existing simulation and debugging tools do not make it possible to
clearly address this issue. This paper defines a generic modeling
and analysis framework to support the design exploration for
energy-driven computing. It uses stochastic hybrid automata
and statistical model-checking. It advocates a distributed system design,
where heterogeneous nodes integrate computing and
harvesting components and support inter-node energy transfer.
Through a simple case-study, the paper shows how this framework
addresses the aforementioned design challenge in a flexible manner
and helps in reducing energy storage requirements.
