## Abstract

Schedulability analysis is a main concern for several embedded applications due to their safety-critical nature. The classical method of response time analysis provides an efficient technique used in industrial practice. However, the method is based on conservative assumptions related to execution and blocking times of tasks. Consequently, the method may falsely declare deadline violations that will never occur during execution. This paper is a continuation of previous work of the authors in applying extended timed automata model checking (using the tool UPPAAL) to obtain more exact schedulability analysis, here in the presence of non-deterministic computation times of tasks given by intervals [BCET,WCET]. Considering computation intervals makes the schedulability of the resulting task model undecidable. Our contribution is to propose a combination of model checking techniques to obtain some guarantee on the (un)schedulability of the model even in the presence of undecidability.
