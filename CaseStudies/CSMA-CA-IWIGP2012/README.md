## Abstract

This paper studies the problem of computing Nash equilibrium in wireless networks modeled by
Weighted Timed Automata. Such formalism comes together with a logic that can be used to describe
complex features such as timed energy constraints. Our contribution is a method for solving this
problem using Statistical Model Checking. The method has been implemented in UPPAAL model
checker and has been applied to the analysis of Aloha CSMA/CD and IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA
protocols.
