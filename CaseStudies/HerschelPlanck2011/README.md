## Abstract
Abstract This chapter shows how UPPAAL is applied in schedulability analysis of
satellite attitude and orbit control software used in Herschel/Planck mission. Our
method transforms the schedulability analysis into reachability analysis performed
by UPPAAL. The chapter briefly describes the schedulability requirements and elaborates
on the modeling framework designed to handle single processor hardware
with a fixed priority preemptive scheduler, detailed task specifications, two resource
sharing protocols and voluntary task suspension. The results include qualitative an-
swers (whether the system is schedulable) as well as quantitative (response and
blocking time estimates) which are comparable with classical response-time analysis.
